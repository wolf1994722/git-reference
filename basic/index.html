  <h2>Basic Snapshotting</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>
    Git is all about composing and saving snapshots of your project and then
    working with and comparing those snapshots.  This section will explain
    the commands needed to compose and commit snapshots of your project.
    </p>

    <p>
    An important concept here is that Git has an 'index', which acts as sort
    of a staging area for your snapshot.  This allows you to build up a series
    of well composed snapshots from changed files in your working directory, 
    rather than having to commit all of the file changes at once.
    </p>

    <p class="nutshell">
    <strong>In a nutshell</strong>, you will use <code>git add</code> to start tracking new
    files and also to stage changes to already tracked files, then 
    <code>git status</code> and <code>git diff</code> to see what has been
    modified and staged and finally <code>git commit</code> to record your
    snapshot into your history.  This will be the basic workflow that you use
    most of the time.
    </p>

<div class="box">
  <h2>
    <span class="docs">
      <a href="#">docs</a> &nbsp;
      <a href="#">book</a>
    </span>
    <a name="add">git add</a>
    <span class="desc">adds file contents to the staging area</span>
  </h2>

  <div class="block">
    <p>
    In Git, you have to add file contents to your staging area before you 
    can commit them.  If the file is new, you can run <code>git add</code>
    to initially add the file to your staging area, but even if the file
    is already "tracked" - ie, it was in your last commit - you still need
    to call <code>git add</code> to add new modifications to your staging
    area. Let's see a few examples of this.
    </p>

    <p>Going back to our Hello World example, once we've initiated the project,
    we would now start adding our files to it and we would do that with 
    <code>git add</code>.  We can use <code>git status</code> to see what the
    state of our project is.
    </p>

<pre>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
<span class="red">??</span> README
<span class="red">??</span> hello.rb
</pre>

    So right now we have two untracked files.  We can now add them.

<pre>
<b>$ git add README hello.rb</b>
</pre>
    
    Now if we run <code>git status</code> again, we'll see that they've been
    added.

<pre>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
<span class="green">A</span>  README
<span class="green">A</span>  hello.rb
</pre>

    <p>OK, so now if we edit one of these files and run <code>git status</code>
    again, we will see something odd.</p>
<pre>
<b>$ vim README</b>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
<span class="green">A</span><span class="red">M</span> README
<span class="green">A</span>  hello.rb
</pre>

    <p>The 'AM' status means that the file has been modified on disk since we
    last added it.  This means that if we commit our snapshot right now, we will
    be recording the version of the file when we last ran <code>git add</code>,
    not the version that is on our disk.  Git does not assume that what the file
    looks like on disk is neccesarily what you want to snapshot - you have to
    tell Git with the <code>git add</code> command.
    </p>

    <p class="nutshell">
    <strong>In a nutshell</strong>, 
    you run <code>git add</code> on a file when you want to 
    include whatever changes you've made to it in your next commit snapshot.
    Anything you've changed that is not added will not be included - this means
    you can craft your snapshots with a bit more precision than most other SCM
    systems.</p>

    <p>For a very interesting example of using this flexibility to stage only
    parts of modified files at a time, see the '-p' option to 
    <code>git add</code> in the Pro Git book.</p>

<div class="box">
  <h2>
    <span class="docs">
      <a href="#">docs</a> &nbsp;
      <a href="#">book</a>
    </span>
    <a name="status">git status</a>
    <span class="desc">view the status of your files in the working directory and staging area</span>
  </h2>

  <div class="block">
    <p>As you saw in the <code>git add</code> section, in order to see what the
    status of your staging area is compared to the code in your working 
    directory, you can run the <code>git status</code> command. I demonstrated
    using it with the <code>-s</code> option, which gives you short output.
    Without that flag, the <code>git status</code> command will give you more
    context and hints.  Here is the same status output with and without the 
    <code>-s</code>.  The short output looks like this:
    </p>

<pre>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
<span class="green">A</span><span class="red">M</span> README
<span class="green">A</span>  hello.rb
</pre>

    Where the same status with the long output looks like this:

<pre>
<b>$ git status</b>
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
# <span class="green">new file:   README</span>
# <span class="green">new file:   hello.rb</span>
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
# <span class="red">modified:   README</span>
#
</pre>

    <p>You can easily see how much more compact the short output is, but the
    long output has useful tips and hints as to what commands you may want to 
    use next.
    </p>

    <p>Git will also tell you about files that were deleted since your last 
    commit or files that were modified or staged since your last commit.</p>

<pre>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
<span class="green">M</span>  README
 <span class="red">D</span> hello.rb
</pre>

    You can see there are two columns in the short status output.  The first
    column is for the staging area, the second is for the working directory.
    So for example, if you have the README file staged and then you modify
    it again without running <code>git add</code> a second time, you'll see 
    this:

<pre>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
<span class="green">M</span><span class="red">M</span> README
 <span class="red">D</span> hello.rb
</pre>

    <p class="nutshell">
    <strong>In a nutshell</strong>, 
    you run <code>git status</code> to see if anything has been modified 
    and/or staged since your last commit so you can decide if you want to
    commit a new snapshot and what will be recorded in it.
    </p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="box">
  <h2>
    <span class="docs">
      <a href="#">docs</a> &nbsp;
      <a href="#">book</a>
    </span>
    <a name="diff">git diff</a>
    <span class="desc">shows diff of what is staged and what is modified but unstaged</span>
  </h2>

  <div class="block">
    <p>There are two main uses of the <code>git diff</code> command.  One use we
    will describe here, the other we will describe later in the 
    <a href="/inspection">"Inspection and Comparison"</a>
    section. The way we're going to use it here is to describe the
    changes that are staged or modified on disk but unstaged.</p>

    <h4>
      git diff
      <small>show diff of unstaged changes</small>
    </h4>

    <p>Without any extra arguments, a simple <code>git diff</code> will display
    in unified diff format (a patch) what code or content you've changed in your
    project since the last commit that are not yet staged for the next commit
    snapshot.
    </p>

<pre>
<b>$ vim hello.rb</b>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
 <span class="red">M</span> hello.rb
<b>$ git diff</b>
<span class="umber">diff --git a/hello.rb b/hello.rb
index d62ac43..8d15d50 100644
--- a/hello.rb
+++ b/hello.rb</span>
<span class="lblue">@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@</span>
 class HelloWorld
   
   def self.hello
<span class="red">-    puts "hello world"</span>
<span class="green">+    puts "hola mundo"</span>
   end
 
 end
</pre>

    <p>So where <code>git status</code> will show you what files have changed 
    and/or been staged since your last commit, <code>git diff</code> will
    show you what those changes actually are, line by line.  It's generally
    a good follow-up command to <code>git status</code>
    </p>

    <h4>
      git diff --cached
      <small>show diff of staged changes</small>
    </h4>

    <p>The <code>git diff --cached</code> command will show you what contents
    have been staged.  That is, this will show you the changes that will 
    currently go into the next commit snapshot.  So, if you were to stage
    the change to <code>hello.rb</code> in the example above, 
    <code>git diff</code> by itself won't show you any output because it will
    only show you what is <i>not yet</i> staged.
    </p>

<pre>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
 <span class="red">M</span> hello.rb
<b>$ git add hello.rb </b>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
<span class="green">M</span>  hello.rb
<b>$ git diff</b>
<b>$ </b>
</pre>

    <p>If you want to see the staged changes, you can run 
    <code>git diff --cached</code> instead.</p>

<pre>
<b>$ git status -s</b>
<span class="green">M</span>  hello.rb
<b>$ git diff</b>
<b>$ </b>
<b>$ git diff --cached</b>
<span class="umber">diff --git a/hello.rb b/hello.rb
index d62ac43..8d15d50 100644
--- a/hello.rb
+++ b/hello.rb</span>
<span class="lblue">@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@</span>
 class HelloWorld
   
   def self.hello
<span class="red">-    puts "hello world"</span>
<span class="green">+    puts "hola mundo"</span>
   end
 
 end
</pre>

    <h4>
      git diff HEAD
      <small>show diff of all staged or unstaged changes</small>
    </h4>

    <p>If you want to see both staged and unstaged changes together, you
    can run <code>git diff HEAD</code> - this basically means you want to
    see the difference between your working directory and the last commit,
    ignoring the staging area. If we make another change to our 
    <code>hello.rb</code> file then we'll have some changes staged and some
    changes unstaged.  Here are what all three <code>diff</code> commands
    will show you:</p>
<pre>
<b>$ vim hello.rb </b>
<b>$ git diff</b>
<span class="umber">diff --git a/hello.rb b/hello.rb
index 4f40006..2ae9ba4 100644
--- a/hello.rb
+++ b/hello.rb</span>
<span class="lblue">@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@</span>
 class HelloWorld
   
<span class="green">+  # says hello</span>
   def self.hello
     puts "hola mundo"
   end
 
 end
<b>$ git diff --cached</b>
<span class="umber">diff --git a/hello.rb b/hello.rb
index 2aabb6e..4f40006 100644
--- a/hello.rb
+++ b/hello.rb</span>
<span class="lblue">@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@</span>
 class HelloWorld
 
   def self.hello
<span class="red">-    puts "hello world"</span>
<span class="green">+    puts "hola mundo"</span>
   end
 
 end
<b>$ git diff HEAD</b>
<span class="umber">diff --git a/hello.rb b/hello.rb

   def self.hello
<span class="red">-    puts "hello world"</span>
<span class="green">+    puts "hola mundo"</span>
   end
 
 end
</pre>

    <p>
    You can also provide a file path at the end of any of these options
    to limit the <code>diff</code> output to a specific file or subdirectory.
    </p>


    <p class="nutshell">
    <strong>In a nutshell</strong>, 
    you run <code>git diff</code> to see details of the <code>git status</code>
    command - <i>how</i> files have been modified or staged on a line by line
    basis.
