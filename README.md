Online Git Reference
====================

I've been giving out git reference cards and wanted a sort of online version
of that.  A list of the common commands, grouped by task, with the common
invocations in an easy to reference site.  This is my shot at that site - 
hopefully it is a nice way to get into this stuff if someone is intimidated
by the pro git book.
