      <br/>
      
    	<p>My name is Scott Chacon. I am a 
    	<a href="http://github.com/schacon">software developer</a>,

    	father, husband, cat rescuer, baby signer
    	and gorilla tamer. 
    	Not neccesarily in that order.</p>
    	<p>This is my little bit-box on the web where I put
    	stuff that people for some inconceivable reason
    	might want to find out about me.</p>
    	<p>I work at <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. And it is awesome.</p>

    	  <ul>

    		<li>Did a scared E.T. impersonation in front of a crowd in Las Vegas</li>
    		<li>Memorized the "Countries of the World Song" from Anamanics</li>

    		<li>Had a mountain gorilla pull on my leg</li>
    		<li>Ran a trail marathon on Mount Diablo</li>
    		<li>Performed in Oklahoma! with Zach Levi (of NBCs Chuck)</li>
    		<li>Flew over 100,000 miles to 31 cities in 13 countries since joining GitHub</li>

    	  at a GitHub drinkup in your area, I'll tell you all about them.</p>
